## Tests
Application was tested with and Cypress (e2e and unit).  As the app is quite small and there is not much server-side functionality, I decided to cover everything with e2e tests. By the way, there is one unit test, which parse outcoming data. 
Section 2 is unable to test as all functionality is handled by Google.
